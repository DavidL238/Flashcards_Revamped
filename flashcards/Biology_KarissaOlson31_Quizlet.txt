Rough ER|network of tubular membanes within the cytoplasm of the cell with a rough surface (ribosomes are attached to it); helps the ribosomes make proteins, such as insulin

plasma membrane|forms a flexible boundary between the living cell and its surroundings; made if phospholipids
nucleus|oval-shaped organelle that contains DNA and controls much of the cell's activities by directing protein synthesis
mitochondrion|carries out cellular respiration; rod-shaped organelle that makes energy for the cell to function with; converts the energy stored in food to energy the cell can use (ATP); "powerhouse" of cell
nucleolus|nuclear subdomain that assembles ribosomal subunits in eukaryotic cells; makes rRNA to form the subunits of ribosomes, which then exit to the cytoplasm
chromatin|complex of DNA and proteins that form within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells; directs the cells' functions
vacuole|sac-like organelle that holds water, food and organisms; can also store waste products until removed
chloroplast|green structure that captures energy from sunlight and changes it to energy that cells can use in making food.
prokaryote|plant, bacteria or archea cell
eukaryote|animal cell with nucleus
ribosomes|small grain-shaped organelle that produces proteins
cell membrane|thin, flexible barrier that surrounds the cell and controls what goes in and out; found in animal cells
cytoplasm|the thick fluid region of a cell inside the membrane or next to the nucleus
lysosome|membrane-enclosed sac of digestive enzymes; contains chemicals that break down bigger food particles so they can be used in the cell; also break down used cell parts. The cell's "recycling center".
cell wall|rigid layer surrounding the cells of plants
multicellular|made of many cells
unicellular|single-celled organism
centriole|small set of microtubules arranged in a specific way
phospholipid bilayer|thin membrane of lipid molecules
cytosol|part of cytoplasm not held by an organelle
cilia|the appendages that propel certain cells
cytoskeleton|networks of protein fibers that extend through the cell
cell theory|all living things are composed of cells and all cells come from other cells
why are cells so small?|smaller cells have more surface area across which to pass oxygen, nutrients and waste materials
flagella|a projection from a prokaryotic cell that propels it through its liquid environment
cellular metabolism|chemical activities of cells
nuclear envelope|double membrane enclosing the nucleus; controls the flow of materials in and out of the nucleus
where are ribosomes found?|free-floating in the cytosol, or bound to the rough ER or the nuclear envelope
vesicle|sacs made of membranes
what makes up the endomembrane system?|nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, lysosomes, vacuoles and the plasma membrane.
What does the Golgi apparatus do?|processes, warehouses and ships (outside and inside cell) ER products
cristae|folds in the mitochondria that increase the surface area and therefore its ability to produce ATP
ATP|Adenine Triphosphate - main energy source for cellular work
stroma|...
thylakoids|...

Nucleus|What organelle functions to isolate a human cell's chromosomes from the cytoplasm?
Cell|What is the basic unit of life?

Body Systems|Sets of organs in our bodies that do the work to keep us healthy and alive.
cells|Small part of all living things.
Organs|Made of thousands of cells, connected by several body systems to do work to keep our bodies healthy &amp; alive.
photosynthesis|Conversion of light energy from the sun into chemical energy.products of photosynthesis are glucose and oxygen
photosynthesis equation(very important)|6CO2 + 6H2O --&gt; light energy --&gt; C6H12O6 + 6O2
chloroplasts|A structure in the cells of plants and some other organisms that captures energy from sunlight and uses it to produce food.main function of chloroplasts is to produce food (glucose)Chloroplasts contain the pigment, chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs most of the colors in the color spectrum, and reflects only green and yellow wavelengths of light. This is why we see leaves as green or yellow - because these colors are reflected into our eyes.
glucose|another name for sugar C6H12O6three things used for making glucose are sunlight water and carbon dioxide used for energy and growth
